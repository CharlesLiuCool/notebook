### Putnam: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy

- Study of 20 regional governments in Italy from 1970s to early 1990s
	- Similar political institutions *BUT* differed in their cultural contexts
- Key Question: Why are regional governments in the north of Italy more effective than regional governments in the south?
	- Northern Italy: strong civic culture
	- A more active civil society -> norm of citizens taking part in politics, and social events within their broader community
	- Value of social networks: emphasis on reciprocity and social cooperation
- What makes a successful democracy?
	- A strong level of mutual trust amongst citizens

### Putnam: Bowling Alone

- Focus on the decline of social networks, especially in the United States
	- Decline of unions, religious groups, Boy/Girl scout volunteers, parent-teacher associations, Freemasonry, etc.
		- Broader societal changes: more women entering workplace, urban mobilization, TV and internet
- Negative consequences for American democracy:
	- Decreased voter turnout
	- Decreased work/membership with political parties
	- Growing distrust amongst citizens, and distrust for politicians

### Inglehart: Values and Democratic Stability

- Broad conceptualization of civic culture:
	- A coherent set of personal life satisfaction, political satisfaction, interpersonal trust, and support for the existing social order
	- Countries that rank highly according to these elements are much likelier to be stable democracy
- Operationalization and measurement:
	- Survey data and analysis: Industrial countries based on annual surveys between 1973 and 1987
	- How to measure X?
		- To what extent are you satisfied with life as a whole?
		- To what extent do you think most people are trustworthy?
			- Range on scale of 0 to 10
			- To what extent do you think most people are trustworthy?
				- Range on scale of 0 to 10
				- e.g. "very satisfied/trustworthy" as 10, "very dissatisfied/untrustworthy" as 0
		- How to measure Y?
			- Number of years that society has had continuous democratic institutions.

### But, Economics Matter too for Inglehart

Economic change -> cultural change -> stable democracy

Industrialization -> shift from traditional to secular-rational values -> civic culture

- Role of technology and economic growth:
	- People have more autonomy over their lives
	- More resources
	- Their concerns shift
- Shift to personal/individual autonomy
	- Move away from all-encompassing religious doctrines that apply to everyone
	- Respect for difference, right to live life as they please (within limits)
	- Self-expression
	- Questioning of authorities, hierarchies, dogmatism
	- This is "secular-rational"
	- THIS is civic culture
