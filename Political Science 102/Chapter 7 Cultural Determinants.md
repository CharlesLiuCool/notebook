### Classic Cultural Arguments

**Constructivist**: argues that culture is built rather than passed down. They argue that culture doesn't make democratization not for everyone.

**Primordialist**: argues that culture is inherited and passed down. These people argue that democracy is not for everyone.

**Cultural Modernization Theory**: argues economics doesn't directly cause democracy, but instead that economics changes culture which causes democracy.

### Three Types of Political Culture

**Parochial**: Suitable for African tribes and such. It's where people have limited awareness of their government.

**Subject**: Suitable for centralized authoritarian systems. Citizens see themselves as subjects to the government.

**Participant (Civic Culture)**: Suited for democracy. Citizens see themselves as actively participating in and contributing to government.

### World Values Survey

Conducted in 8 different societies.

Main problems are:
- Hard to conduct surveys in dictatorships
- Same question can be interpreted differently by different people

### Arguments for Democratic Compatibility

>[!book] Huntington argues in *"Clash of Civilizations"* that democracy isn't compatible with all religions, such as Islam, Catholic, and Confucianism.
>
All religions, however, have elements that make them seem both compatible and incompatible with democracy.

>[!book] Many argue Islam is incompatible with democracy since there aren't many Islamic democracies.
>These people obviously haven't taken 8th grade Geometry. You can't base a claim like this.


### Empirical Evidence for Emergence of Democracies

- Increased wealth makes transitions to democracy more likely.  
- High economic growth makes transitions to democracy less likely.  
- Countries that are predominantly Catholic are more likely to become democracies.  
- Having a Protestant or Muslim majority has no effect on whether a country becomes democratic or not.  
- Ethnic, religious, and cultural diversity do not appear to impede or aid the emergence of democracy.

### Empirical Evidence for Survival of Democracies

- Increased wealth helps democratic survival
- High economic growth helps democratic survival
- Having a Muslim majority does not harm democratic survival.  
- Having a Protestant majority is good for democratic survival.  
- Having a Catholic majority is bad for democratic survival.   
- Ethnic and cultural (but not religious) diversity seems to be bad for democratic survival.
