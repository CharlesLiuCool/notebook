**Normative claims:** 
Based on bias and opinion.

**Aesthetic claims:** 

**Subjective** - biased and debatable
**Empirical** - can be taken as the truth
**Descriptive**

**Confirmation bias:** You see what you want to see.

We are prone to *systematic errors* in the way that we want to see the world.

Due to features of our cognitive system, and that we often make opinions based on ambiguous or unclear data.

The primary principle of studying politics is to attempt to *falsify* our hypothesis, not to confirm them.

We need systematic methods, methods

Are belief in the credibility of the claim should be based on the credibility of their process.

### Comparative Politics:
It is *NOT*/we will not be doing:
- Reviewing countries one-by-one
	- We want to remain broad and open-minded
	- You can be more focused in your country-case assignments

What it is
- Comparison (and contrast) of countries' domestic political affairs
- In the U.S. context: traditionally everything outside of the US.

Three broad theories of viewing
- Political Culture
- Political Institutions
- Political Economy

At the broadest level:
- Culture is associated with political outcomes
- Institutions are associated with political outcomes
- Economic interest are associated with political outcomes

The world is messy:
- There is a mix of things going on
- We want our explanations to be coherent and try to accurately describe what's happening

### Political Culture

Norms, values, beliefs, religion affect political outcomes.

### Political Institutions
- Presidential v. parliamentary systems
- Electoral systems
	- Majoritarian vs proportional representation
	- Accountable vs representative politics
- Political parties


### Political Economy
- Economic interests
	- "Rational", self-interested actors
	- Politicians, citizens, other elites
	- E.g. unemployment -> propensity to protest


### State Formation
- The nation state and borders are not self-evident
	- Origins? Why do we have nations states? Where did they come from?
	- Begin by looking at Europe
		- Various kingdoms, highly decentralized
		- Over time: more centralized
			- Culturally: language, norms, stereotypes
			- Politically: administration
		- Post-colonial states:
			- Did not follow the same trajectory
				- "Stunted growth" as a result of "Europe getting there first"

### Social Movements and Protest Politics
- Why form social movements?
	- Goals?
	- How cohesive and successful are they?
		- Opportunities and constraints
	- Why do people protest, and when?
		- Collective action

### Democracies and Authoritarian Regimes

- What does it mean to be a democracy?
	- How do we observe and measure democracy?
- What is an authoritarian regime?
- And what about the variations
	- How have they evolved over time?
	- Is authoritarianism -> democracy really a linear, one way process?
	- How may the two be "mixed"

### Identity: class, race, gender, and more

- To some extent, class
	- Though we explore this before through economic interests
- Race and gender
	- How are identities constructed?
	- How are power structures built?
	- How does this affect political outcomes?
		- Power struggles, individual agency, group identity
		- Materialism vs. ideas


### Ethnic Conflict and Civil Wars

- Why/how do civil wars occur?
	- Economic interests e.g. seizing different resources
		- Opportunities
	- Political culture
		- And differences
- Ethnic conflict
	- What is ethnic conflict, and how may it affect political outcomes?

>[!lightbulb] Conclusion
>Civic culture is necessary for a stable democracy.
