## Array Terminology

An **array** is a data structure used to implement a list of primitive objects.

An **element** is a single value in the array.

The **index** of an element is the position of the element in the array
>[!tip] Important!
>In Java, the first element is zero.

The **length** of an array is the number of elements in the array.
>[!tip] Important!
>`length` is a `public final` data member of an array
>Since `length` is `public`, we can access it in *any class*!
>Since `length` is `final`, we cannot change an array's `length` after it has been set. This means array have static size which poses limitations.
> - Note: `final` is similar to `const` in C++ but it applies to classes too! (Among other differences)

The last element of an array list is at index `list.length - 1`

## Declaring and Modifying Arrays

```java
//declaring
int [] list = new int[5];

//modifying element at index 3
list[3] = 14;
```

We can make arrays of non-primitive objects:

```java
public class Data {
	private int value;
	private String name;

	//constructor, mutators, accessors, methods
}

public static void main(String args[]) {
	Data [] newArr = new Data[6];
	//note the new array is a size 6 array of the reference value null
	newArr[0] - new Data("40");
}
```
