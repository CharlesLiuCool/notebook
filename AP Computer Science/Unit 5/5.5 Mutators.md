Commonly referred to as *"setters"*, these allow the changing of private attributes in an object built from a class.

```java
public class Pikachu {
	private String nickname;
	private String level;

	//Constructors and Getters here

	//Setters
	public void setNickname(String newName) {
		nickname = newName;
	}

	public void setLevel(String newLevel) {
		level = newLevel;
	}
}
```
