Using the keyword `this` allows it to be clear that the variable in question is the data member of an object and not some other variable explicitly.

```java
public class Pikachu {
	private int level;

	public String getLevel() {
		return level;
	}

	public boolean isSameLevel(Pikachu pikachu2) {
		return this.level.equals(pikachu2.level);
	}
}
```

`this` refers to the object that was used to call the method.
That means, in the case of:
```java
public static void main(String args[]) {
	//assume constructor exists
	Pikachu jerry = new Pikachu("5");
	Pikachu barry = new Pikachu("3");
	jerry.isSameLevel(barry);
}
```

jerry is `this`, not barry.
