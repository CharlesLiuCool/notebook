## Creating Objects
**Constructors** are used to initialize the attributes for an object.
```java
public Person(String nm, int ag, boolean ad) { 
	name = nm;
	age = ag;
	isAdult = ad;
}
```
___
The entire line
```java
public Person(String nm, int ag, boolean ad) { 
```
is called the **signature**, which contains the name of the constructor and the parameter list.
___

The things passed in inside the parenthesis,
```java
String nm, int ag, boolean ad
```
are called the **formal parameters**.
___
The values that you pass in the call,
such as

```java
Person("Charles", 16, 0);
```
is called **call by value**
___
Constructors are used to initialize the attributes for an object
```java
Person charlesLiu = new Person("Charles", 16, 0);
```
The values in the parenthesis are called the **actual parameters**.
___
## Overloading Constructors

We can have more than one constructor for an object. This is called **overloading** the constructor. A **no-argument constructor** has no parameters and sets the instance variables for object to default values.

___
**Example:**
```java
/*
* Programmer: Charles Liu
* Purpose: Demonstrate object instantiation and constructors
*/

public class Car {
	private String make;
	private boolean isSports;
	private String owner;

	public boringCar() { //default constructor
		make = null;
		isSports = false;
		owner = null;
	}
	//parameterized constructor (probably don't need to know this name for the test)
	public customCar(String mk, boolean sports, String own) { 
		make = mk;
		isSports = sports;
		owner = own;
	}
	//initializing my car as an object from the blueprint (customCar class) using the constructor
	Car myCar = new customCar("Toyota Camry LE 2010", false, "Charles");
}
```

___

The keyword `null` is a special value used to indicate that a reference is not associated with any object. It can be reset to a custom value with proper use of constructors later on however.
