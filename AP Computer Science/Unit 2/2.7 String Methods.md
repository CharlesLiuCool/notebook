There are built-in functions we can use to analyze, operate on, and modify strings.

## Using the `indexOf()` method.

```java
int indexOf(String str)
```
returns the index of the first occurrence of `str`; returns `-1` if not found.

**Example:**
```java
String myName = new String("Charles Liu");

System.out.println(myName.indexOf("i"));
```

This would return:

```
9
```


|  0   |   1  | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   C  |   h  | a | r | l | e | s |

| 8 | **9** | 10 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L | **i** | u |

## Operator Overload

This is where two methods/constructors have the **same name** but **different method signature**, or parameters accepted. They are differentiated by the compiler based on the amount/type of parameters you put it when calling the method.

## Using the `substring()` method

```java
String substring(int from, int to)
String substring(int from)
```
