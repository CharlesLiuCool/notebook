## Arithmetic Operators

| **Symbol** | **Name** | **Example** | **Result** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| + | Addition | 7 + 3 | 10 |
| - | Subtraction | 7 - 3 | 4 |
| * | Multiplication | 7 \* 3 | 21 |
| / | Division | 7 / 3 | 2 (note that integer division truncates)|
| % | Modulus | 7 % 3 | 1 (finds remainder) |

Using arithmetic operators on two of the same datatype will result in the same datatype
e.g. `int` / `int` = `int`, `double` + `double` = `double`

The result of mixing datatypes will always be the larger datatype
e.g. `double` * `int` = `double`

### Compound Expressions

We can take multiple of our operators and use them in one expression.

e.g. `8 * 6 - 14 % 3 + 8 / 2`

*Operator precedence* of mathematics still applies! (Recall PEMDAS);

| Operator | Type | Direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `()` | Parenthesis | Left to Right |
| `* / %` | Multiplication, Division, Modulus | Left to Right |
| `+ -` | Addition, Subtraction | Left to Right |

>[!question] Example
>What would the following result in within the Java coding language?
8 * 6 - 14 % (3 + 8) / 2

>[!check]- Solution
8 * 6 - 14 % 11 / 2
48 - 14 % 11 / 2
48 - 3 / 2
Integer division results in a truncated integer result
48 - 1
47

You can include variables within operation expressions as long as they are initialized correctly.

### The Assignment Operator

Assign the value on the *right* of the **assignment operator** to the variable on the left.

```java
x = 7;
y = 8 + 4 * x;
```

You can take a variable and assign it a value
>[!check] Good
`x = 7`

but you cant assign a value, or literal, a variable
>[!bug] Bad
`7 = x`

Assignment Operator (`=`) goes **right to left**.

>[!question] Practice
>1. Declare an integer variable called `firstValue`, and set its initial value to 13.
>2. Declare a double variable called secondValue and set its initial value to 18.5
>3. Declare a third variable (think about the required type) called `sumOfValues` and set its value to the sum of `firstValue` and `secondValue`

>[!check] Solution

```java
public class method {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		int firstValue = 13;
		double secondValue = 18.5;
		double sumOfValues = firstValue + secondValue;
	}
}
