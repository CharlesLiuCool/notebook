### Struct Type

C supports another kind of user-defined type: the `struct`.
`structs` are a way to combine multiple variables into a single package (*"encapsulation"*)

Suppose we want to create a database of students in a course. We could define a student `struct` as follows:

```c
typedef enum {freshman, sophomore, junior, senior} class_type; // class standing

typedef enum {anthropology, biology, chemistry, english, compsci, polisci, psychology, physics, engineering, sociology} major_type; //major

typedef struct {
	int id_number;
	class_t class_standing;
	major_t major;
	double gpa;
	int credits_taken;
} student_type;
```

We can define some students:

```c
student_type student_1, student_2;
student1.id_num = 123456789;
student.class_standing = freshman;
student.major = anthropology;
student1.gpa = 3.5;
student1.credits_taken = 15;
student2.id_num = 321123456;
student2.class_standing = senior;
student2.major = biology;
student2.gpa = 3.2;
student2.credits_taken = 100;
```

We can copy a whole `struct` by using the assignment operator

```c
student_type student3 = student1;
```

### C Supported Datatypes

C supports a variety of different *integer* formats

| **Type** | **# of bits in Microsoft Visual C** |
| -------- | -------- |
| `Short` | `16`|
| `unsigned short` | `16` | 
| `int` | `32`| 
| `unsigned int` | `32` | 
| `long` | `32` | 
| `unsigned long` | `32` |

> **NOTE:** *unsigned* just means the variable only supports *non-negative* values.

C also supports a variety of different *double* formats

| **Type** | **# of bits in Microsoft Visual C** |
| -------- | -------- |
| `float` | `32`|
| `double` | `64` | 
| `long double` | `64`|

>Do **NOT** use floating point values for things like for loop conditions!

This may result in **round-off errors**!

- Don't rely on two floating-point values being equal:
```c
//NO!
for (trial = 0; trial != 10.00; trial += 0.1) {
	//code here
}
//dangerous...
```

- Even the following may not execute the same number of times on all computers:
```c
for (trial = 0; trial < 10.0; trial += 0.1) {
	//code here
}
//BAD!
```

>**Remark:** Its better to use integers as loop counters.

### Conversions between `int` and `double`

When we assign an `int` to a `double` or a `double` to an `int`, C performs an automatic conversion:

```c
int k = 5, m = 4, n;
double x = 2.5, y = 4.1, z;
z = k + x; // 7.5: k is converted to double PRIOR to +
z = k \ m // k / m is evaluated first, 5 / 4 = 1 after integer division, 1 is converted to double. Result: 1.0
n = x * y;  // x * y is evaluated first 2.5 * 4.1 = 10.25. Result converted to integer. Result = 10.
```

>**NOTE:** Explicit casting is always an option. They don't change the internal representation of the variable however.

___

### Conversions between `char` and `int`

Converting between `char` and `int` just uses the ASCII table to convert.

___
### Enumerated Types

> Define custom data types (i.e., days of the week, months of the year, household budget categories, business inventory categories, etc.)

We can do this with C *enumerated* types.

```c
typedef enum {
	clothing, household, electronics, garden, health_beauty, sporting_goods
}
```

>**NOTE:** `clothing` assigned to integer value 0, `household` gets integer value 1, ...`sporting_goods` gets integer value 5.

so:
```c
printf("clothing: %d\n", clothing);           // Outputs: 0
printf("household: %d\n", household);         // Outputs: 1
printf("electronics: %d\n", electronics);     // Outputs: 2
printf("garden: %d\n", garden);               // Outputs: 3
printf("health_beauty: %d\n", health_beauty); // Outputs: 4
printf("sporting_goods: %d\n", sporting_goods); // Outputs: 5`
```

Once we've defined an `enumerated` type, we can declare variables of that type

`inv_type inv_kind;`

and use the type in `switch` statements

```c
void print_inventory(inv_type inv_kind) {
	switch (inv_kind) {
		case clothing:
			printf("clothing");
			break;
		case household:  
			printf("household");  
			break;  
		case electronics:  
			printf("electronics");  
			break;  
		case garden:  
			printf("garden");  
			break;  
		case health_beauty:  
			printf("health and beauty");  
			break;  
		case sporting_goods:  
			printf("sporting goods");  
			break;  
	}
}
```

We can cast `enumerated` types to `int`.
```c
int household_val;
inv_type this_inv;
household_val = (int) household
```

and cast integers to the enumerated type:
```c
this_inventory = (inv_type)(electronics + 1);
```

### Common Enum - Boolean

```c
typedef enum boolean {
	FALSE, TRUE
} Boolean;

typedef enum month {
	JAN = 1, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP OCT, NOV, DEC
} Month;
```
