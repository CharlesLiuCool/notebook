####  Chapter 2: Overview of C

**What is an algorithm?**
- We should specify algorithms with pseudocode before we implement them in C

**Define what is a variable**
- Memory is allocated when a variable is declared
**Define what is a datatype**
**List three types supported by C**
- integer (int)
- Double precision floating-point (double)
- Character (char)
Define the role of preprocessor directives
Define and apply escape sequences (the newline (\n) is an example of an
escape sequence)
o Other escape sequences include horizontal tab (\t), backslash (\\), and
double quote (\”)
Describe the role of main ( ) in every C program
Explain the purpose of the { and } curly braces used with main ( ) (and any
function for that matter)
o Every function body must begin with a { and end with a }
List an example of a literal string
o “CptS 121 is amazing!”
o Literal strings are used in printf ( )
Explain the role of return 0 in main ( )
o Indicates the program terminated successfully
Describe what is a syntax error; which software tool reports these errors?
Explain what is a logic error
Describe the rules for naming an identifier; consider C constraints and naming
conventions used in the class
C is case sensitive
Define and apply Boolean expressions
Apply operators to C types
o Arithmetic operators include: +, -, *, /, and %
Construct and evaluate valid numerical expressions, including mixed-type
expressions
Apply operator precedence
o *, /, % have the same precedence
o +, - have the same precedence, but lower than *, /, %
Distinguish between = and ==
Compare implicit type casting to explicit type casting
Apply printf ( ) and scanf ( )
Describe what is a prompt
Describe and apply elements of “good” C style and “best” programming
practices
Provide logical memory diagrams that represent variables
What is the general algorithm applied to problems in this course?
o Get inputs
o Perform computations
o Output results
Chapter 3: Top-Down Design with Functions
Apply top-down design principles
o Divide and conquer
o Structure charts
Apply bottom-up design principles
o We apply bottom-up implementation frequently in the course; we
implement solutions to the sub-problems before we implement main ( )
Define what is a function in C
o General rule-of-thumb is 1 function = 1 algorithm = 1 task
What is cohesion and coupling?
Construct functions that solve sub-problems
Define formal parameter, actual argument, local variable, function header
Describe what is a function prototype
o Declaration to compiler of newly defined function; name, order of
arguments and corresponding types, and return type are very important
Cite advantages of defining functions in C
What are the 3 parts to a function header?
What is a function call? How do actual arguments relate to function calls?
Define what is scope
How do functions communicate with main ( ) and vice versa?
What is a calling function? What is a called function?
Apply C math library functions
o Some of these include: sqrt ( ), pow ( ), floor ( ), ceil ( ), sin ( ), cos ( ),
etc.
Define and apply test drivers
Arguments in C are passed-by-value (copies)
What is functional decomposition and abstraction?
Chapter 4: Selection Structures
What is a conditional statement?
Describe what is short circuit evaluation?
o Applies to conditional statements with compound logic
Construct flowcharts for a particular problem
List and apply relational operators
o These include: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
List and apply logical operators
o These include: !, &&, ||
Construct if-else statements in C
Construct nested if statements
How is false defined in C? How about true?
Apply Boolean operator precedence
File Processing
What is a file stream?
Apply fopen ( ), fclose ( ), fscanf ( ), and fprintf ( )
o You should be able to open files for read and write modes
Which standard streams are created when a C program executes?
