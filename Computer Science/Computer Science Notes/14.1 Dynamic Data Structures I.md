### Dynamic Data Structures

- Structures that expand and contract as a program executes
- Memory is allocated as needed (dynamically)
- We can use dynamic memory allocation to dynamically allocated an array at runtime
	- This, there's no need to constrain the maximum size of an array at compile time

Memory can be allocated to store any of the simple or structured data types described throughout this course (i.e. `structs`, `ints`, `doubles`, etc.)

Separately allocated structured blocks are called *nodes*

These *nodes* can be used to form composite structures that expand and contract while the program executes.
