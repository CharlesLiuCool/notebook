#### Abstract Thinking
> Setting a general foundation/outline to solve a solution


#### Algorithm
> A sequence of clearly ordered instructions that helps reach a solution in a finite amount of time

#### String Manipulation in C

>The string-handling library <string.h> provides many powerful functions which may be used in place of standard operators
- strcpy() replaces the assignment operator
- strcat() replaces the + or operator
- strcmp() replaces relational
- etc.

If we supply only one parameter in a 2-D array, it gives the starting point of the unknown parameter.
