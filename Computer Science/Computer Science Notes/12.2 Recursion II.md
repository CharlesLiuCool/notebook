### Recursive Functions

### Recall

>A recursive function is one that calls itself either directly or indirectly through another function
>Recursion may be replaced by an iterative (loops) solution

### Advantages of Recursion

May provide a simpler solution than an iterative one
- Sometimes iterative solutions lend themselves to complex algorithms
May lead to reduction in *code size*
May lead to reduction in *time complexity*

### Disadvantages of Recursion

May require large amounts of memory
- For each call to the function more memory is allocated for local variables
- Call stack continues to grow for each call; may lead to stack overflow
	- Recall the call stack keeps track of a point to which each active function or subroutine should return control when finished
Difficult to test and debug

### Factorial Example

The factorial of a positive number $\large{n}$ (including zero) is represented as $\large{n!}$ 
$\large{n!}$ is the product of all of the positive integers less than or equal to $\large{n}$ (not including zero)

i.e. $\large{3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6}$

Below is a recursive solution to $\large{n!}$

```c
int rec_factorial(int n){ 
	int result = 0;
	if (n == 0 || n == 1) { //base case
		result == 1;
	}
	else { //recursive step
		result = n * rec_factorial(n - 1);
	}
	return result;
}
```
