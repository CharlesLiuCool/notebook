Standard operators such as (`==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) *cannot* be applied to strings in C.
#### String Manipulation in C

>The string-handling library `<string.h>` provides many powerful functions which may be used in place of standard operators

- `strcpy(destination, source)` replaces the assignment operator *\=*
- `strcat(destination, source)` replaces the *+* or operator
- `strcmp(destination, source)` replaces relational operator *\==*
- `strtok(destination, soruce)` replaces the next occurrence of a delimiter with the null character `'\0'`
- `memset(row of 2-D array, value you want to set it to, length of the row);` often used to set values to null character
- etc.

`strtok(my_str, ',');` can be used to replace the commas in the string to the null character (Great for `.csv` data manipulation!)

>**NOTE**: If delimiter does not exist in the string, it will go to the null character, stop, and return first address of the string

To access these functions, we have to include the `string.h` library

```c
#include <string.h>
```

Examples of using `<string.h>` functions

`strcpy()`.
```c
char string1[20] = "Charles Liu";
char string2[20];
strcpy(string2, string1);
puts(string2); //displays: Charles Liu
//string2 is now "Charles Liu\0"
```

Similar function `strncpy()`.
```c
char string1[20] = "Charles Liu";
char string2[20];
strncpy(string2, string1, 7);
puts(string2); //displays: Charles
//string2 is now "Charles\0"
```

We have to be careful when using these functions to make sure we don't put too many characters in an array that can't take that many.

```c
char string1[20] = "Charles Liu";
char string2[4] = "Mir";
strncpy(string2, string1, 7); //breaks
//string 2 can only take 4 characters, but strncpy() put in 7!
```

We can use the following method to guard against this situation:
```c
strncpy(destination, source, destination_length - 1);
destination[dest_length - 1] = '\0'
```
### Substrings 

We can start `strncpy()` from the middle of a string to copy parts of it.

```c
char string1[25] = "Charles Liu";
char string2[4];
strncpy(string2, &string1[9]);
puts(string2); //displays Liu
//string2 is now "Liu\0"
```

___

`strtok()`
Suppose I want to extract the first name `"Charles"`, last name `"Liu"`, status `"Cool"`, and grade `"11"` from "`Charles, Liu, Cool, 11`"

```c
char info[25] = "Charles, Liu, Cool, 11";
char info_copy[25];
char *first_name, *last_name, *status, *grade;
strcpy(info_copy, info);
first_name = strtok()
```

If we supply only one parameter in a 2-D array, it gives the starting point of the unknown parameter.
