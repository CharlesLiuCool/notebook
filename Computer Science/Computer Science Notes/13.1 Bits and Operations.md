### Basic Memory Concepts

> **Recall:** 
> - when a variable is declared, memory is allocated based on its data type
> - Some of the major data types in C include: `char`, `int` and `double`.
> - A basic English character (`char`) requires less memory than an (`int`)
> - An integer (`int`) requires less memory than a double precision floating-point value (double)
> - `sizeof(char) < sizeof(int) < sizeof(double)` - sizeof() in C returns the number of bytes allocated for a variable or datatype.

All information is stored in memory as *bit(s)* of data.
- Bit is derived from **b**inary **d**igit
- A binary digit, or bit, has two possible values; 0 or 1

A sequence of 4-bits is called a *nibble*
- One example of a nibble of data is $\large{1111_2}$
	- This is the number 15 in decimal
	- Note the leftmost 1 is referred to as the most significant bit (msb) and the right most 1 is the least significant bit (lsb)

A sequence of 8-bits is called a *byte*
- One example of a byte of data is $\large{0100\;0001_2}$
	- This is the number 65 in decimal
	- It's also the ASCII value for `A`

### Number Systems

Decimal and binary systems are called *positional* number systems.

A digit from one of these systems has a *weight* dependent on its position or location within the string of digits

Each position is weighted as the base of the system to a power.
- Decimal is base 10
- Binary is base 2

A *binary number* consists of one or more bits
