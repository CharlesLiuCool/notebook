#### String Manipulation in C

>The string-handling library <string.h> provides many powerful functions which may be used in place of standard operators
- `strcpy(char* destination, char* source)` replaces the assignment operator *\=*
- `strcat()` replaces the *+* or operator
- `strcmp()` replaces relational operator *\==*
- `strtok()` replaces the next occurrence of a delimiter with the null character `'\0'`
- `memset(row of 2-D array, value you want to set it to, length of the row);` often used to set values to null character
- etc.

`strtok(my_str, ',');` for example replaces the commas in the string to the null character

>NOTE: If delimiter does not exist in the string, it will go to the null character, stop, and return first address of the string

If we supply only one parameter in a 2-D array, it gives the starting point of the unknown parameter.

#### Structs

>C supports another kind of user-defined type: the `struct`. 
>`struct` are a way to combine multiple variables into a single "package"(also known as *encapsulation*)
>Sometimes referred to as *aggregate*, where all variables are under the same name

```c
struct student_record {
	int id;
	char lastname[30];
	char firstname[30];
	double gpa;
}```
```c
int main(void) {
	struct student_record student1;
	return 0;
}
```
