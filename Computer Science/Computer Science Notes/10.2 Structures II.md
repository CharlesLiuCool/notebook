#### Structs

>C supports another kind of user-defined type: the `struct`. 
>`struct` are a way to combine multiple variables into a single "package"(also known as *encapsulation*)
>Sometimes referred to as *aggregate*, where all variables are under the same name

```c
struct student_record {
	int id;
	char lastname[30];
	char firstname[30];
	double gpa;
}
```

```c
int main(void) {
	struct student_record student1;
	return 0;
}
```
