### Arrays

- A sequence of items that are contiguously allocated in memory

- All items in the array are of the same data type and of the same size

- All items are accessed by the same name, but a different index

>An `array` is a data structure
- A data structure is a way of storing and organizing data in memory so that it may be accessed and manipulated efficiently

Store related information (i.e., Student ID numbers, Names of players on the Seattle Mariners roster, Scores for each combination in Yahtzee, etc.)

### Dimensions of an Array

- A single dimensional array is logically viewed as a linear structure
- A two dimensional array is logically viewed as a table consisting of rows and columns
- What about three, four, etc., dimensions? Same idea.

### Array Declaration

Arrays are declared in the same way as variables:

```c
int a[6];
```
declares an array `a` with 6 cells that hold integers:

| `a[0]` | `a[1]` | `a[2]` | `a[3]` | `a[4]` | `a[5]` | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `10` | `12`| `0` | `89` | `1`| `91` |
Notice that array indexing begins at 0.

We can declare arrays alongside simple variables
```c
int students[100], count, teachers[50];
double gpa[100], average;
char ch, name[100]; //name still gets set to a string
```

Assuming the previous array:

| `a[0]` | `a[1]` | `a[2]` | `a[3]` | `a[4]` | `a[5]` | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `10` | `12`| `0` | `89` | `1`| `91` |

all of the following statements are valid:

```c
a[0] = 4; //changes a[0] from 10 to 4
a[2] += 2; //changes a[2] to value of a[2] + 2 or 0
a[5] = a[3] - a[4]; // sets the value of a[5] to 88
```

We can initialize arrays at the same time we declare them

like we can do 
```c
int count = 0;
```

is valid, so too is

```c
int student_id[] = {3423, 8794, 4595, 1423, 4311};
```

Notice how you can omit the size of the array. The compiled deduces the size from the number of values listed.

### Array Subscripts

We can do arithmetic on array subscripts! Assume this array:

| `a[0]` | `a[1]` | `a[2]` | `a[3]` | `a[4]` | `a[5]` | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `10` | `12`| `0` | `89` | `1`| `91` |

Then all of the following are valid:

```c
int x = 2;
printf("%d", a[x + 2]); //a[4] == 1
printf("%d", a[2 * x - 1]); //a[3] == 89
printf("%d", a[x] - a[x - 1]); // -12
printf("%d", a[++x]); //a[3] == 89; x == 3
a[x - 1] = a[x - 2]; // assigns 12 to a[2]
printf("%d", a[x + 4]); // Does a[7] exist
```

Write a segmented of code that creates an array of 10 doubles values, populates the array with the values 1.0 through 10.0, and finally exchanges the 1st and 10th values.

```c
double arr_double[10];
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	arr_double[i] = (double) i+1;
}
int temp = 0;
temp = arr_double[0];
arr_double[0] = arr_double[9];
arr_double[9] = temp;
```
