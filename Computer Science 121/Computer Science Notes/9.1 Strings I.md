A string is a sequence of characters terminated by the null character `'\0'`.

- A string may include letters, digits, and special characters
- A string is accessed via a pointer to the first character in it

>**NOTE:** A string may always be represented by a character array, but a character array is not a string

```c
char my_string[10] = ['m', 'y', '_', 's', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g' '\0'];
// string and character array

char my_string[9] = ['m', 'y', '_', 's', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g']; 
//character array only
```

String length in declaration must always account for the null terminator!

```c
char my_string[10] = "my_string"; // correct
char my_string[9] = "my_string"; // incorrect
```

We can specify a *field width* in a `printf` statement involving a string (`%s`). By default the string is right justified within that field, e.g.,

```c
printf("string value: |%11s|\n", my_string);
```

*Right justified* aligns to the right side (field length i.e., `11` is greater than 0).
Since in the code above `11` is bigger than the string length of `10`, it outputs the string and `11-10 = 1` extra spaces to the left of the displayed string.

```c
// result:
//| my_string|
```

For left justification,
```c
printf("string_value: |-11%s|\n", my_string);
```

*Left justified* aligns to the left side (field length i.e., `-11` is less than 0).
Since in the code above, `11` is bigger than the string length of `10`, it outputs `11-10 = 1` extra spaces to the right of the displayed string.

```c
// result:
//|my_string |
```

### Arrays of Strings

```c
char* name[5] = {"string1", "string2", "string3", "string4", "string5"};
```

>**NOTE:** You have to use the indirection operator (\*) for defining arrays of strings. This is because you want the address of the beginning of each of the strings in your array, so you have an array of addresses.
