### Recursion

The *process* in which a function calls itself either directly or indirectly through another function

The function that is called is known as *recursive* function
i.e.,
```c
int recursive_function (int r, int s) {
	//...
	recursive_function(r, s-1) //recursive call
	//...
}
```

### Nature of Recursion

Problems that may be solved using recursion have these attributes
- One or more simple cases have a straightforward, non-recursive solution
- The other cases may be defined in terms of problems that are closer to simple cases
- Through a series of calls to a recursive function, the problem eventually is stated in terms of the simple cases

As described by Wirth:
>[!quote] Wirth- 
>"The power of recursion evidently lies in the possibility of defining an infinite set of
objects by a finite statement. In the same manner, an infinite number of computations can
be described by a finite recursive program, even if this program contains no explicit 
repititions".


- A divide and conquer approach
- A fresh copy of a function goes to work on a similar, but simpler problem than the original
- May be used as an alternative to iteration

### Properties of Recursion

- Recursive solution have at least two cases:
	- The simple or *base* case(s)
	- The *recursive* case(s) or step(s)

### Example of Recursive Solution

```c
int multiply (int m, int n) {
	int ans;
	if (n == 1) {
		ans = m;
	}
	else {
		ans = m + multiply (m, n - 1); //recursive step
	}
	return ans;
}
```
