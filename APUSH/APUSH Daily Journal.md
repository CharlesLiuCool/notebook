> >
It is the interchange between the worlds of Africa, Europe, and the Americas, and their cultures and goods. This brought the roots of why the US is largely European-based, with the original European settlers taking over the Natives’ land. This also brought a large amount of Africans over to the US, as they were originally sold as slaves, and wiped out Natives as the Europeans spread disease.

They were so diverse because so many different groups from different areas came for different reasons to the Americas.

Both sides(France and Britain) had expansion of territories and began to encroach on each other’s territories.

Some effects include short term improved relations between colonies and the British as the British helped colonists fight for land.

It is called Problem of Empire because Britain was having various problems. This includes economics, as they fought a costly French and Indian War, which although they won, they had to burn a lot of money. The Americans were also beginning to rebel against the ever-so encroaching British, which needed money from them.

The Declaration of Independence should be considered more of a break up letter, as although America officially declared themselves “independent”, they developed this rebelling nature against the British much earlier.

>[!clock] 10/4
> >[!question] #2 What factors will ultimately help the American colonists earn independence from Great Britain?

Their strong leadership, especially with George Washington as a prominent general helped the Americans win the war against the British. The emergence of enlightenment ideals and British acts of heavy taxation also angered and united the colonies against them. They implemented guerilla warfare tactics, not abiding by normal war “rules”, and were able to kill a lot of British. France joins in as well and helps the Americans.

#3 Why is Washington called “The Father of our Country”?

He is called the father of our country since he was one of the most important generals in the American Revolution against the British and a key factor to the colonists’ success. Furthermore, he was also a key member in the writing of the Constitution.

10/9

#4 Why in 1787 will the US scrap its government & create a new one?

The US government initially had the Articles of Confederation as its form of government. There were flaws however, and many people were dissatisfied, so the Constitutional Convention was held to rewrite the government. States had a lot of power to implement their own laws and government, and there were lots of inconsistencies between states. This would lead to the Shays Rebellion where Daniel Shay would lead an armed rebellion against the federal government alongside farmers to demand better treatment. Large states supported the Virginia Plan, which wanted state representation to be based on population, whereas smaller states wanted to support the New Jersey Plan, which proposed each state have equal representation. The convention would produce the “Senate” and “House of Representatives”, Senate is one state with one vote, and the House of Representatives is based on state population.

#9 What were some challenges the U.S. faced as a young nation?

Some challenges the U.S. faced were disagreements of methods of governing, finance, and setting foreign relation positions. The originally used Articles of Confederation were debated among the leading politicians at the time, and they held the Philadelphia Convention, where James Madison’s Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan clashed, supporting representation by population vs representation by state respectively. Furthermore, when Hamilton established the excise tax, many people were unhappy, and an armed rebellion led by Daniel Shay led farmers to attack the government. The position the United States had for France during the French Revolution was also a challenge, as although France helped the U.S. in the American Revolution, helping the French monarchy could threaten the existing U.S. nation. George Washington chose not to help.

After the American Revolution, the early 1800s saw leaders such as Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington. A new generation of leaders emerged in the 1820s and 30’s such as Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay.

He was popular in his day because he helped gain land for the southern plantation owners by kicking out the Spanish and natives. This helped the westward expansion of the United States.

>[!clock] 11/2
> > [!question] #1 How would you describe the relationship between the US government & Native American nations in the 1800s and today?

Native Americans and the US government conflicted, fighting over land as the US expanded westward. The US attempted to kick Natives out of the lands they had lived in for centuries, and the Natives fought back. They did not coexist peacefully.
> > 
Today, Native Americans live in small secluded reservations of land that usually have little monetary value and are far from their original homes. The Natives were greatly reduced, and the remainder had distrust in the US government which didn’t honor their treaties.

I think it's okay to keep him there since he is a core part of American history, and back then people had different values and he did uphold them.

Women’s rights activism was similar to the abolitionist movement in that they both tried to fight for the rights of a group of people who were being discriminated against. Some differences were the abolitionist movement had people who were not discriminated against in their group, but women’s rights activism had mostly women involved. The abolitionist movement led to a huge war (Civil War), but women’s rights did not result in such a violent war.

During the 1800’s, people of many different religions moved to the US, such as Catholics, Jews, and Protestants. This shift in religious makeup in the United States influenced many political decisions, as many religious groups opposed the abolitionist movement. Furthermore, churches such as the Mormon Church were founded in this period.

The U.S. will fight a war with Mexico since they are already at land conflicts, as the U.S. wanted to expand and supported the idea of “manifest destiny”. Since there was gunfire between Mexico and U.S. citizens, Polk acted on this and attacked Mexico.

Westward expansion led to the appending of new states such as Kansas. It was widely disputed over whether new states should be pro or anti-slavery, and abolitionist and pro-slavery groups clashed in events such as Bleeding Kansas, which would build tension for the Civil War.

>[!clock] 11/30

Imperialism means you have outer connections with other countries, but isolationism is secluding your country. The pros to imperialism are you have outer connections and technology can be spread between your country and others, but the cons could be an outer negative influence. For isolationism, no outer connections mean you can prosper by yourself, but you have no outer support. 

>[!clock] 12/1

The “tipping point” that led most to the Civil War was the attack on Harper’s Ferry, where John Brown tried to seize weapons and arm a slave uprising. It ultimately failed and he was caught and hung, but tensions between the North and South over slavery were exacerbated.

>[!clock] 12/4
> >[!question] #13 Why do you think the North will ultimately win the Civil War?
> >
The North would win due to their greater supply of resources and troops, which overpowered the seceded South. They also had strong leadership under great generals such as Ulysses S. Grant. They also had railroads, stronger banks, and a greater food supply, which is surprising since the South was agricultural-based.
