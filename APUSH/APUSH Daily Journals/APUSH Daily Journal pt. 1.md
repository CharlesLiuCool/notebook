>[!clock] 9/1
> >[!question] #3 Who gets more respect in history, Amerigo Vespucci or Christopher Columbus? Why?
> >
Christopher Columbus gets more respect since he is so much more well-known. Although the Americas are named after Vespucci, few know about its relation to him.

>[!clock] 9/6
> >[!question] #4 What is the Columbian Exchange and how does it connect to modern society?
> >
It is the interchange between the worlds of Africa, Europe, and the Americas, and their cultures and goods. This brought the roots of why the US is largely European-based, with the original European settlers taking over the Natives’ land. This also brought a large amount of Africans over to the US, as they were originally sold as slaves, and wiped out Natives as the Europeans spread disease.

> >[!question] #5 What do you think happened to the Roanoke Colonists?
> >
I think the Roanoke colonists all died out because that seems the most reasonable in my opinion. The combination of diseases and starvation makes their chance of survival slim to none.

>[!clock] 9/15
> >[!question] #10 What is salutary neglect? Show an example.
> >
It was when Britain loosened its grip on the colonies and trusted them to govern themselves. Britain was busy fighting wars, and let them do this. They would later reassert their grip, however, due to the 7 Years War, and the colonists would be angry with this.

There are visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic. I learn the best by watching visuals and listening at the same time, and also writing down the material with notes.

> >[!question] #13 What is a pro & con to group projects and presentations?

A pro is you get to see many different people’s perspectives on topics and gain a deeper understanding. A con is that everyone thinks differently and you cannot give the presentation completely how you want to.

>[!clock] 9/22
> >[!question] #14 Why were the American Colonies culturally diverse?

They were so diverse because so many different groups from different areas came for different reasons to the Americas. English Puritans came to escape from religious persecution, Quakers came for religious peace, Africans came as slaves, people in debt came as indentured servants, wealthy people making profits in plantations, etc.

>[!clock] 9/25
> >[!question] #15 Share a cause and effect for the French and Indian War.
> >
Both sides(France and Britain) had expansion of territories and began to encroach on each other’s territories. The British began trading with Natives on land which the French claimed, and both sides fought. Some effects include short term improved relations between colonies and the British as the British helped colonists fight for land.

>[!clock] 9/27
> >[!question] #16 Why is Ch. 5 called “Problem of Empire”?
> >
It is called Problem of Empire because Britain was having various problems. This includes economics, as they fought a costly French and Indian War, which although they won, they had to burn a lot of money. The Americans were also beginning to rebel against the ever-so encroaching British, which needed money from them.

>[!clock] 9/28
> >[!question] #17 Was it “Common Sense” for the American Colonies to unify & break away from Great Britain.

Yeah. The British were imposing taxes and policies that would make the Americans better off without them.
