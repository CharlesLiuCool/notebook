> > [!question] #1 How would you describe the relationship between the US government & Native American nations in the 1800s and today?
> > 
Native Americans and the US government conflicted, fighting over land as the US expanded westward. The US attempted to kick Natives out of the lands they had lived in for centuries, and the Natives fought back. They did not coexist peacefully.
> > 
Today, Native Americans live in small secluded reservations of land that usually have little monetary value and are far from their original homes. The Natives were greatly reduced, and the remainder had distrust in the US government which didn’t honor their treaties.

> >
I think it's okay to keep him there since he is a core part of American history, and back then people had different values and he did uphold them. I think it would be better to change him for another influential person who also upholds the ideals that we support today since it would be more meaningful.

> >[!question] #3 Until Lincoln, why did American Presidents not end slavery?
> >
Slavery was a huge part of the Southern economy, and ending it would for sure result in Southern rebellions. To keep political unity, presidents kept slavery.

>[!clock] 11/8
> >[!question] #4 Compare and contrast early to mid-1800s women’s rights activism with the abolitionist movement.
> >
Women’s rights activism was similar to the abolitionist movement in that they both tried to fight for the rights of a group of people who were being discriminated against. Some differences were the abolitionist movement had people who were not discriminated against in their group, but women’s rights activism had mostly women involved. The abolitionist movement led to a huge war (Civil War), but women’s rights did not result in such a violent war.

> > [!question] #5 What role did religion play in 1800’s America?
> >
During the 1800’s, people of many different religions moved to the US, such as Catholics, Jews, and Protestants. This shift in religious makeup in the United States influenced many political decisions, as many religious groups opposed the abolitionist movement. Furthermore, churches such as the Mormon Church were founded in this period.

> >
It’s known as Manifest Destiny since settlers believed it was their destiny to manifest the westward lands to the Pacific Ocean.

> [!clock] 11/16
> > [!question] #7 Why will the U.S. fight a war with Mexico in 1846?
> >
The U.S. will fight a war with Mexico since they are already at land conflicts, as the U.S. wanted to expand and supported the idea of “manifest destiny”. Since there was gunfire between Mexico and U.S. citizens, Polk acted on this and attacked Mexico.

> >[!question] #8 What was your favorite chapter of the book?

Humans commit violence against one another for safety, wealth, land, food, family/friends, and much more.

> [!clock] 11/29
> > [!question] #10 What are some connections between westward expansions & slavery?
> >
Westward expansion led to the appending of new states such as Kansas. It was widely disputed over whether new states should be pro or anti-slavery, and abolitionist and pro-slavery groups clashed in events such as Bleeding Kansas, which would build tension for the Civil War.

>[!clock] 11/30
> >[!question] #11 What are some differences between isolationism & imperialism? Pros & Cons?
> >
Imperialism means you have outer connections with other countries, but isolationism is secluding your country. The pros to imperialism are you have outer connections and technology can be spread between your country and others, but the cons could be an outer negative influence. For isolationism, no outer connections mean you can prosper by yourself, but you have no outer support.

> >[!question] #12 What “tipping point” most led to the start of the Civil War?
> >
The “tipping point” that led most to the Civil War was the attack on Harper’s Ferry, where John Brown tried to seize weapons and arm a slave uprising. It ultimately failed and he was caught and hung, but tensions between the North and South over slavery were exacerbated.

>[!clock] 12/4
> >[!question] #13 Why do you think the North will ultimately win the Civil War?
> >
The North would win due to their greater supply of resources and troops, which overpowered the seceded South. They also had strong leadership under great generals such as Ulysses S. Grant. They also had railroads, stronger banks, and a greater food supply, which is surprising since the South was agricultural-based.

>[!clock] 12/6
> >[!question] #14 Why is Lincoln ranked as the #1 president and considered the right leader at the right time?
> >
He is ranked so high since he generally made the right decisions in critical moments and helped lead the abolitionist movement to victory. He also was crucial in the winning of the Civil War.

>[!clock] 12/7
> >[!question] #15 Why did Lincoln wait until 1863 to issue the Emancipation Proclamation?
> >
Issuing the Emancipation Proclamation risks rebellions from slave states and the division of the United States. By waiting until the Union victory, the Proclamation is on more favorable grounds.

> >[!question] #17 What is the total war? What impact did Sherman’s March to the Sea have on the South?
> >
Total war is where nearly all resources are allocated towards war and there’s no holding back. Sherman’s March to the Sea destroyed much of the South’s resource supply and helped them win the war.

I have broken my friend’s side door. I have no clue if it was fixable, and their parents were not happy.

>[!clock] 12/14
> >[!question] #19 How do you think the Civil War & Reconstruction is viewed today in the South?
> >
I think it is largely ignored, as it is such a long time ago that people don’t remember the details and stuff. Some hate probably still exists, as organizations such as the KKK still exist.

>[!clock] 12/15
> >[!question] #20 Was Reconstruction more failure or success? Why?
> >
I think the Reconstruction was on track to become a major success, but President Andrew Johnson’s term in office largely continued racism and brought upon segregation, making it more of a failure.

Your greatest strength is the knowledge you have of the material and rubric and the experience and practice you have on the question types. The biggest challenge is not getting discouraged or nervous if you don’t know something and keeping track of time. I am best at the LEQ and worst on the MCQ.
