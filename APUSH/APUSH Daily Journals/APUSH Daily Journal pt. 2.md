> >
The Declaration of Independence should be considered more of a break up letter, as although America officially declared themselves “independent”, they developed this rebelling nature against the British much earlier.

Their strong leadership, especially with George Washington as a prominent general helped the Americans win the war against the British. The emergence of enlightenment ideals and British acts of heavy taxation also angered and united the colonies against them. They implemented guerilla warfare tactics, not abiding by normal war “rules”, and were able to kill a lot of British. France joins in as well and helps the Americans.

#3 Why is Washington called “The Father of our Country”?

He is called the father of our country since he was one of the most important generals in the American Revolution against the British and a key factor to the colonists’ success. Furthermore, he was also a key member in the writing of the Constitution.

#4 Why in 1787 will the US scrap its government & create a new one?

The US government initially had the Articles of Confederation as its form of government. There were flaws however, and many people were dissatisfied, so the Constitutional Convention was held to rewrite the government. States had a lot of power to implement their own laws and government, and there were lots of inconsistencies between states. This would lead to the Shays Rebellion where Daniel Shay would lead an armed rebellion against the federal government alongside farmers to demand better treatment. Large states supported the Virginia Plan, which wanted state representation to be based on population, whereas smaller states wanted to support the New Jersey Plan, which proposed each state have equal representation. The convention would produce the “Senate” and “House of Representatives”, Senate is one state with one vote, and the House of Representatives is based on state population.

#7 What were some challenges John Adams faced as the 2nd president?

A big challenge was the division in government. Although Adams was a federalist, he was more moderate in his standing, so he was caught between the more extreme federalists such as Hamilton and the antifederalists.

#9 What were some challenges the U.S. faced as a young nation?

Some challenges the U.S. faced were disagreements of methods of governing, finance, and setting foreign relation positions. The originally used Articles of Confederation were debated among the leading politicians at the time, and they held the Philadelphia Convention, where James Madison’s Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan clashed, supporting representation by population vs representation by state respectively. Furthermore, when Hamilton established the excise tax, many people were unhappy, and an armed rebellion led by Daniel Shay led farmers to attack the government. The position the United States had for France during the French Revolution was also a challenge, as although France helped the U.S. in the American Revolution, helping the French monarchy could threaten the existing U.S. nation. George Washington chose not to help.
