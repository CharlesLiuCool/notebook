## Equation of a Line

A **vector equation of the line** passing through the point $\large{P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)}$ in the direction of the vector $\large{{\bf v} = \langle a, b, c\rangle}$ is $\large{{\bf r} = {\bf r}_0 + t{\bf v}}$, or
$$\large{\langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle + t\langle a, b, c\rangle \text{, for } -\infty < t < \infty}$$

Equivalently, the corresponding **parametric equations of the line** are
$$\large{x = x_0 + at, y = y_0 + bt, z = z_0 + ct \text{, for } -\infty < t <  \infty}$$

### Examples from textbook section 13.5

Given equations for two lines in space, There are **four** possibilities:

1. The lines are parallel and do not intersect: ![[Lines and Vectors 2024-01-17 17.24.31.excalidraw]]

2. The lines are parallel and do intersect (they're the same line): ![[Lines and Vectors 2024-01-17 17.27.54.excalidraw]]

3. The lines are "skew" (non-parallel and non-intersecting): ![[Lines and Vectors 2024-01-17 17.29.13.excalidraw]]

4. The lines are not parallel and intersect: ![[Lines and Vectors 2024-01-17 17.31.13.excalidraw]]

### The equation of a plane in a space

Suppose we know a point $\large{P_0}$ (with position vector $\large{\vec{r}_0}$) that's on the plane, and a vector $\large{\vec{n}}$ that's perpendicular (a.k.a. normal) to the plane:

![[Untitled 2024-01-16 08.45.01.excalidraw|800]]

## Definition: Plane in $\large{\mathbb{R}^3}$
Given a fixed point $\large{P_0}$ and a nonzero *normal vector* $\large{\bf n}$, the set of points $\large{P}$ in $\large{\mathbb{R}^3}$ for which $\large{\vec{P_0P}}$ is orthogonal to $\large{\bf n}$ is called a **plane**

## General Equation of a Plane in $\large{\mathbb{R_3}}$
The plane passing through the point $\large{P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)}$ with a nonzero normal vector $\large{{\bf n} = \langle a, b, c \rangle}$ is described by the equation
$$\large{\begin{align} &a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0 \text{, or } ax + by + cz = d \text{, where } \\ \\ &d = ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 \text{.} \end{align}}$$

## Definition: Parallel and Orthogonal Planes
Two distinct planes are **parallel** if their respective normal vectors are parallel (that is, the normal vectors are scalar multiples of each other). Two planes are **orthogonal** if their respective normal vectors are orthogonal (that is, the dot product of the normal vectors is zero).
