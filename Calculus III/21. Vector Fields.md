A **vector field** (of dimension $\large{n}$) is a function whose inputs & outputs are both $\large{n}$-dimensional.

*Examples:*
$\large{\vec{F}(x,y,z) = \langle x^2 + y, xz, xy \rangle}$
3D input -> 3D output

$\large{\vec{F}(x,y) = \langle x, -y \rangle}$
2D input -> 2D output

**Note:** The gradient of a function is always a field.
For $\large{f(x,y) = x^2 - xy^2 + 2y}$
$\large{\nabla = \langle 2x-y^2, -2xy + 2 \rangle}$

In such a case, $\large{f}$ is called the *"potential function"* for its own gradient field.

>For $\large{\vec{F}(x,y) = \langle x,y \rangle}$ and the curve $\large{C = \{(x,y):x=1\}}$
>a) Determine the points on $\large{C}$ at which $\large{\vec{F}}$ is tangent to $\large{C}$.
>b) Determine the points on $\large{C}$ at which $\large{\vec{F}}$ is normal to $\large{C}$.
>c) Sketch $\large{C}$ and a few vectors on $\large{\vec{F}}$ on $\large{C}$.

>[!check]- Solution
>a) None, since on $\large{C}$, $\large{(x,y) = (1,y)}$, so $\large{\vec{F}(1,y) = \langle 1,y \rangle}$ <- never vertical
>b) $\large{(1,0)}$, Has to be on the curve $\large{(x,y) = (1,y)}$, and $\large{\vec{F}(x,y) = \vec{F}(1,y) = \langle 1,y \rangle = k \langle 1,0 \rangle}$ so $\large{1 = k}$, $\large{y = 0}$, Sp $\large{(x,y) = (1,0)}$
>c) Use your brain

>[!question] 48
>Find the gradient field $\large{\vec{F} = \nabla \varphi}$ for the potential function $\large{\varphi (x,y) = x + y}$. Sketch a few level curves of $\large{\varphi}$ and a few vectors of $\large{\vec{F}}$.

>[!check]- Solution
>$\large{\nabla \varphi = \nabla (x+y) = \langle \varphi_x, \varphi_y \rangle = \langle 1, 1 \rangle}$

>[!tip] NOTE:
>Not every field is a gradient field.
>For example, there is no $\large{\varphi (x,y)}$ such that
>$$\large{\varphi = \langle x,x \rangle}$$
>this would need $\large{\varphi_x = x}$ & $\large{\varphi_y = x}$
>(can use second derivative $\large{\varphi_{xy}}$ and $\large{\varphi_{yx}}$ to prove)
