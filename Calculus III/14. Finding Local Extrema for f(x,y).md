## Definition: Local Maximum/Minimum Values
Suppose $\large{(a,b)}$ is a point in a region $\large{R}$ on which $\large{f}$ is defined. If $\large{f(x,y) \leq f(a,b)}$ for all $\large{(x,y)}$ in the domain of $\large{f}$ and in some open disk centered at $\large{(a,b)}$, then $\large{f(a,b)}$ is a **local maximum value** of $\large{f}$. If $\large{f(x,y) \geq f(a,b)}$ for all $\large{(x,y)}$ in the domain of $\large{f}$ and in some open disk centered at $\large{(a,b)}$, then $\large{f(a,b)}$ is a **local minimum value** of $\large{f}$.

## Definition: Critical Point
$\large{(a,b)}$ is a critical point of $\large{f}$ if $\large{(a,b)}$ is in the interior of the domain of $\large{f}$, and each of $\large{f_x(a,b)}$ and $\large{f_y(a,b)}$ is either zero or undefined.

## Theorem 15.14 Derivatives and Local Maximum/Minimum Values
If $\large{f}$ has a local maximum or minimum value at $\large{(a,b)}$ and the partial derivatives $\large{f_x}$ and $\large{f_y}$ exist...

## Definition: Saddle Point
Consider a function $\large{f}$ that is differentiable at a critical point $\large{(a,b)}$. Then $\large{f}$ has a **saddle point** at $\large{(a,b)}$ if, in every open disk centered at $\large{(a,b)}$, there are points $\large{(x,y)}$ for which $\large{f(x,y) > f(a,b)}$ and points for which $\large{f(x,y) < f(a,b)}$

>$$\large{f(x,y) = \dfrac{x^3}{3} - \dfrac{y^3}{3} + 3xy}$$

>[!check]- Solution
>Note polynomials are defined on all real numbers so we can rule out that case
>$\large{f_x = x^2 + 3y = 0}$
>$\large{f_y = -y^3 + 3x = 0}$
>$\large{\implies x = \dfrac{1}{3}y^2}$
>$\large{(\dfrac{1}{3}y^2)^2 + 3y = \dfrac{1}{9}y^4 + 3y = y (y^3 + 27) = 0}$
>$\large{y = 0, -3}$
>So the critical points are $\large{(0,0)}$ and $\large{(3, -3)}$

## Theorem 15.15 Second Derivative Test for f(x,y)
Suppose the second partial derivatives of $\large{f}$ are continuous throughout an open disk centered at the point $\large{(a,b)}$, where $\large{f_x(a,b) = f_y(a,b) = 0}$. Let $\large{D(x,y) = f_xx(x,y)f_yy(x,y) - (f_xy)(x,y))^2}$.
1. If $\large{D(a,b) > 0}$ and $\large{f_xx(a,b) < 0}$, then $\large{f}$ has a local maximum value at $\large{(a,b)}$.
2. If $\large{D(a,b) > 0}$ and $\large{f_xx(a,b) > 0}$, then $\large{f}$ has a local minimum value at $\large{(a,b)}$
3. If $\large{D(a,b) < 0}$, then the test is inconclusive.
