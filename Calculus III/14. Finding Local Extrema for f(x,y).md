## Definition: Local Maximum/Minimum Values
Suppose $\large{(a,b)}$ is a point in a region $\large{R}$ on which $\large{f}$ is defined. If $\large{f(x,y) \leq f(a,b)}$ for all $\large{(x,y)}$ in the domain of $\large{f}$ and in some open disk centered at $\large{(a,b)}$, then $\large{f(a,b)}$ is a **local maximum value** of $\large{f}$. If $\large{f(x,y) \geq f(a,b)}$ for all $\large{(x,y)}$ in the domain of $\large{f}$ and in some open disk centered at $\large{(a,b)}$, then $\large{f(a,b)}$ is a **local minimum value** of $\large{f}$.

## Definition: Critical Point
$\large{(a,b)}$ is a critical point of $\large{f}$ if $\large{(a,b)}$ is in the interior of the domain of $\large{f}$, and each of $\large{f_x(a,b)}$ and $\large{f_y(a,b)}$ is either zero or undefined.

## Theorem 15.14 Derivatives and Local Maximum/Minimum Values
If $\large{f}$ has a local maximum or minimum value at $\large{(a,b)}$ and the partial derivatives $\large{f_x}$ and $\large{f_y}$ exist...

## Definition: Saddle Point
Consider a function $\large{f}$ that is differentiable at a critical point $\large{(a,b)}$. Then $\large{f}$ has a **saddle point** at $\large{(a,b)}$ if, in every open disk centered at $\large{(a,b)}$, there are points $\large{(x,y)}$ for which $\large{f(x,y) > f(a,b)}$ and points for which $\large{f(x,y) < f(a,b)}$

>$\large{f_x = x^2 + 3y = 0}$
>$\large{f_y = -y^3 + 3x = 0}$
>$\large{\implies x = \dfrac{1}{3}y^2}$
>$\large{(\dfrac{1}{3}y^2)^2 + 3y = \dfrac{1}{9}y^4 + 3y = y (y^3 + 27) = 0}$
>$\large{y = 0, -3}$
>So the critical points are $\large{(0,0)}$ and $\large{(3, -3)}$

## Theorem 15.15 Second Derivative Test for f(x,y)
Suppose the second partial derivatives of $\large{f}$ are continuous throughout an open disk centered at the point $\large{(a,b)}$, where $\large{f_x(a,b) = f_y(a,b) = 0}$. Let $\large{D(x,y) = f_{xx}(x,y)f_{yy}(x,y) - (f_xy)(x,y))^2}$.
1. If $\large{D(a,b) > 0}$ and $\large{f_{xx}(a,b) < 0}$, then $\large{f}$ has a local maximum value at $\large{(a,b)}$.
2. If $\large{D(a,b) > 0}$ and $\large{f_{xx}(a,b) > 0}$, then $\large{f}$ has a local minimum value at $\large{(a,b)}$
3. If $\large{D(a,b) < 0}$, then the test is inconclusive.

>$\large{f(x,y) = x^4 + y^4 - 4x - 32y + 10}$

>[!check]- Solution
>$\large{f_x = 4x^3 - 4 = 0}$
>$\large{f_y = 4y^3 - 32 = 0}$
>(decoupled system, only one variable in each equation)
>$\large{x^3 = 1, y^3 = 8}$
>$\large{(x,y) = (1,2)}$
>$\large{f_{xx} = 12x^2, f_{yy} = 12y^2, f_{xy} = 0}$, so $\large{D(x,y) = f_{xx} \cdot f_yy - (f_xy)^2 = (12x^2)(12y^2) - 0^2}$
>So $\large{D(1,2) = 12(48) - 0^2 > 0}$
> $\large{f_{xx}(1,2) > 0, f_{yy}(1,2) > 0}$
> Local minimum at $\large{(1,2)}$

>$\large{f(x,y) = x^2 + xy^2 - 2x + 1}$

>[!check]- Solution
>$\large{f_x = 2x + y^2 - 2 = 0}$
>$\large{f_y = 2xy = 0 \implies x = 0}$ or $\large{y = 0}$
>$\large{y = \pm \sqrt{2}, x = 1}$

> Critical points are $\large{(0, \sqrt{2}), (0, -\sqrt{2}), (1,0)}$
> $\large{D(x,y) = f_{xx} \cdot f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2 = 2 \cdot 2x - (2y)^2 = 4x - 4y^2}$
> $\large{D(1,0) = 2 \cdot 2 - 0 > 0}$ local minimum at $\large{(1,0)}$
> $\large{D(0, \sqrt{2}) = 2(0) - (2\sqrt{2})^2 < 0}$ saddle at $\large{(0, \pm \sqrt{2})}$
