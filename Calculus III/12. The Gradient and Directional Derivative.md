For $\large{f(x,y)}$, the **gradient** (or **gradient vector**) of $\large{f}$ is denoted $\large{\text{grad}(f)}$ or $\large{\nabla f}$ or $\large{\nabla f(x,y)}$, and is defined as
$$\large{\nabla f(x,y) = \langle f_x(x,y), f_y(x,y) \rangle}$$

Gradients are an example of something called a **vector field**. At each different point in the xy-plane, the gradient will have a different vector. The input is two dimensional, and the output is two dimensional.

As mentioned previously, the gradient of $\large{f}$ is a *field*, meaning that the dimensions of its inputs and outputs are the same. Typically, the input for a field is thought of as a location, and the object is thought of as a vector associated with that input location.
For example, for $\large{f(x,y) = \dfrac{1}{2}x^2 + \dfrac{1}{2}y^2}$, $\large{\nabla f = \langle x, y \rangle}$
$\large{\nabla f(x,y) = \langle x, y \rangle}$

## Theorem 15.10 Directional Derivative
Let $\large{f}$ be differentiable at $\large{(a,b)}$ and let $\large{{\bf u} = (u_1,u_2)}$
xy-plane. The **directional derivative** of $\large{f}$ at $\large{(a,b)}$ in the direction of $\large{\bf u}$ is 
$$\large{D_u f(a,b) = \langle f_x(a,b), f_y (a,b) \rangle \cdot \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle = \nabla f(a,b) \cdot \vec{u}}$$

**Note:** Given $\large{f}$ and point $\large{P}$,

$\large{D_\vec{u} f(p) = \nabla f(P) \cdot \vec{u} = |\nabla f(P)| \cdot |\vec{u}|\cdot \cos(\theta) = |\nabla f(P)|\cos(\theta)}$

So $\large{D_\vec{u}f(P)}$ has the maximum positive value when $\large{\theta = 0}$, meaning that $\large{\vec{u}}$ is in the same direction as $\large{\nabla f(P)}$ which means
$$\large{\vec{u} = \dfrac{\nabla f(P)}{|\nabla f(P)|}}$$

Also, $\large{D_\vec{u}f(P)}$ has the minimum negative value when $\large{\theta = \pi}$, meaning that 
$$\large{\vec{u} = -\dfrac{\nabla f(P)}{|\nabla f(P)|}}$$

It follows that

**Another note:**
Since $\large{\nabla f(P)}$ points in the direction that will most rapidly increase the value of $\large{f}$, $\large{\nabla f(P)}$ must be orthogonal to the level curve of $\large{f}$ through $\large{P}$:

## Theorem 15.12 The Gradient

## Theorem 15.13 Directional Derivative and Interpreting the Gradient

Let $\large{f}$ be differentiable at $\large{a,b,c}$ and let $\large{{\bf u} = \langle u_1, u_2, u_3 \rangle}$ be a unit vector. The directional derivative of $\large{f}$ at $\large{\langle a,b,c \rangle}$ in the direction of $\large{\bf u}$
$$\large{D_{\vec{u}}}$$

3. The directional derivative is **zero** in any direction **orthogonal** to $\large{\nabla f(a,b,c)}$.
4. $\large{\nabla f(a,b,c)}$ is **orthogonal** to the level surface at $\large{f}$ containing $\large(a,b,c)$ which has the equation $\large{f(x,y,z) = k = f(a,b,c)}$.
