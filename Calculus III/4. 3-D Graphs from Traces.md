Last Time:
We were graphing 3D surfaces using traces. We're studying mainly cylindrical surfaces and *quadric surfaces*, which will (for us) be of the form

$$\large{Ax^2+By^2+Cz^2+Dx+Ey+Fz+G = 0}$$

Where A, B, C are not all zero

We already graph $\large{x^2 + 2z^2 + y = 4}$:
Traces $\large{y = k}$ are $\large{x^2 + 2z^2 = 4 - k}$,
which are: ![[4. 2024-01-23 08.14.48.excalidraw]]

The surface corresponding to an xyz equation can be shifted by replaing each x by ($\large{x-a}$), each y by ($\large{y - b}$), and/or each z by ($\large{z - c}$)

## 14.1 Space Curves (a.k.a. Vector Valued Functions)

![[4. 2024-01-23 08.36.56.excalidraw 1]]

A line is a space curve & a vector-valued function:

>[!question] 14.1 (9)
>Find a vector-valued function $\large{\vec{r}(t)}$ which describes the line through $\large{(2, 3, 7)}$ and $\large{(4, 6, 3)}$.

>[!check]- Solution
>$\large{\vec{r}(t) = \langle 2, 3, 7 \rangle + \langle 2, 3, -4 \rangle t}$
>or $\large{\vec{r}(t) = \langle 2 + 2t, 3+3t, 7 - 4t \rangle}$


A non-line example:
>[!question] 
>Graph the space curve
$$\large{\vec{r}(t) = \langle \dfrac{2}{\pi},\;2\sin(2t),\;2\cos(2t) \rangle,\;\;\;0 \leq t \leq 2\pi}$$

>[!check]- Solution
>$\large{y^2 + z^2 = (2\sin(2t))^2 + (2\cos(2t))^2 = 4\sin^2(2t) + 4\cos^2(2t) }$
>$\large{= 4 (\sin^2(2t) + \cos^2(2t)) = 4}$
>$\large{\implies y^2 + z^2 = 4}$ (for all t)

We can define limits, continuity and domain for vector-valued functions:
- $\large{\vec{r}(t) = \langle f(t), g(t), h(t) \rangle}$ is continuous at $\large{t = a}$ if and only if $\large{f, g, h}$ are each continuous at $\large{t = a}$
- $\large{t = a}$ is in the domain of $\large{\vec{r}(t)}$ if and only if $\large{t = a}$ is in each of the domains of $\large{f, g, h}$.
>[!question] Example
>Consider $\large{\vec{r}(t) = \langle \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{t}}, e^{-t}, \dfrac{3t}{t - 2} \rangle}$. Find the domain of $\large{\vec{r}}$, discuss the continuity of $\large{\vec{r}}$, and find $\large{\lim_{t\to\infty} \vec{r}(t)}$
