>Determine which pairs of planes are parallel, which are orthogonal, and which are identical

| planes | normal direction vectors |
| --- | --- |
| $\large{Q: 3x-2y+z=12}$ | $\large{\langle 3, -2, 1 \rangle}$ |
| $\large{R: -x+\dfrac{2}{3}y - \dfrac{1}{3}z = 0}$ | $\large{\langle -1, \dfrac{2}{3}}$ |
| $\large{S: -x + 2y + 7z = 1}$ | $\large{\langle -1, 2, 7 \rangle}$ |
| $\large{T: \dfrac{3}{2}x - y + \dfrac{1}{2}z = 6}$ | $\large{\langle \dfrac{3}{2}, -1, \dfrac{1}{2} \rangle}$ |

A final thought from 13.5:

The equation $\large{ax+by+cz = d}$ represents a plane, as long as $\large{a, b, c}$ are not zero. We'll encounter base planes like these a lot:

## Brief conic sections review (for 13.6)

$\large{x^2 + y^2 = a^2}$ (same as $\large{\dfrac{x^2}{a^2} + \dfrac{y^2}{b^2}}$)
$\large{\dfrac{x^2}{a^2} + \dfrac{y^2}{b^2} = }$

## 13.6 Cylinders and Analyzing Surfaces in $\large{\mathbb{R}^3}$

For us, a "surface" is the graph of any single xyz equation in $\large{\mathbb{R}^3}$. A plane is the graph of an equation of the from $\large{ax + by + cz = d}$, and is a surface. The graphs of the following equations are also surfaces:

| $\large{x+3y^2 + z^2 = 5}$ | $\large{xy + z = 1}$ |
| --- | --- |
| $\large{y = \ln(x+z)}$ | $\large{zcos(x) + y^3 = 4}$ |

A "cylinder" (a.k.a. "cylindrical surface) is the graph (in $\large{\mathbb{R}^3}$) of an $\large{xyz}$ equation which is missing one (or two) of these variables, like these:

$$\large{x^2 + z^2 = 1}$$
![[3. 2024-01-18 08.24.27.excalidraw]]

$\large{y + x^2 = 4}$
![[3. 2024-01-18 08.31.21.excalidraw]]

$\large{z = e^{-y}}$

When all these variables are involved, picturing a surface is more complicated. It can often be accomplished using "traces". A trace of a surface is a curve which is formed by intersecting the surface with a plane of the form $\large{x = k, y = k, z = k}$:

>[!question] Example:
>Consider the surface $\large{x^2 + 2z^2 + y = 4}$.
>Let's try to graph it

>[!check]- Solution
>Note that the trace in the plane $\large{y = 0}$ is:
>$\large{x^2 + 2z^2 = 4}$
>$\large{\implies \dfrac{x^2}{4} + \dfrac{z^2}{2} = 1}$

## Quadric Surfaces
**Quadric Surfaces** are described by the general quadratic (second-degree) equation in three variables,
$$\large{Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + Dxy + Exz + Fyz + Gx + Hy + Iz}$$
