### Formal Charge

> [!info] What is formal charge?
Formal charge describes the amount of lone pairs around an atom compared to the optimal amount for stability. A positive formal charge means there is too few electrons around the atom, and a negative formal charge means there is too many.

The formal charge is calculated by solving
$$\large{\text{total \# valence }e^{-1} - \text{ total \# of bonds } - \frac{1}{2}\text{ total \# of nonbonding electrons }}$$

The lewis structure with the most reduced formal charge is the most stable and most likely model.
