### 4 Types of Intermolecular Forces (IMF)

> [!info] Dipole-Dipole
> Dipole-Dipole bonds emerge between molecules when singular molecules are polar. Polarity occurs when the distribution of electrons is asymmetrical. This can happen when:
> 1. Bonded atoms have a high electronegativity difference (> 0.4), and bonds are not across from each other (asymmetrical arrangement of polar bonds)
> 2. Lone pairs enhance asymmetrical electron distribution on a molecule on the brink of polar bonds, making it polar.
