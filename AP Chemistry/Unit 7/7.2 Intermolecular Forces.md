### 4 Types of Intermolecular Forces (IMF)

> [!info] Dipole-Dipole
> Dipole-Dipole bonds emerge between molecules when singular molecules are polar. Polarity occurs when the distribution of electrons is asymmetrical. This can happen when:
> 1. Bonded atoms have a high electronegativity difference (> 0.4), and bonds are not across from each other (asymmetrical arrangement of polar bonds)
> 2. Lone pairs enhance asymmetrical electron distribution on a molecule on the brink of polar bonds, making it polar.

>[!info] Hydrogen Bonding
>Hydrogen bonds, despite the misleading name, are still intermolecular forces, not forces between atoms. These are an example of an especially strong dipole-dipole bond, where a hydrogen atom bonded with a highly electronegative atom attracts with another highly electronegative atom from a separate molecule.

>[!info] London Dispersion Forces (LDF, also known as van der Waal forces)
>London Dispersion Forces are weak intermolecular forces that occur due to temporary fluctuations in electron distribution around a molecule. This creates temporary dipoles. These dipoles can influence and cause temporary dipoles in neighboring molecules, and bring about attraction.
